# Carbon stock formulas and IPCC Approach 1 uncertainty per land use

Builds, for each period and land use of the carbon table, the carbon
stock formula and its variance and relative uncertainty formulas (IPCC
2006, Vol. 1, Ch. 3, Eq. 3.1 and 3.2).

             Each stock is written as \code{C = CF * S_DM + S_C}, with
             \code{S_DM} the sum of pools in dry matter and \code{S_C} the sum
             of pools in carbon. CF is factored once, so its uncertainty is
             not counted as independent across pools:

             \code{Var(C) = CF^2 * V_DM + (CF * CF_U * S_DM)^2 + V_C}

             with \code{V_S = sum((X * X_U)^2)} over the pools of \code{S}.
             With RS, AGB becomes \code{AGB * (1 + RS)} with variance
             \code{(AGB * (1 + RS) * AGB_U)^2 + (AGB * RS * RS_U)^2}, and BGB is
             ignored. If \code{ALL} is given, it replaces the other pools.

             \code{c_tot_U = sqrt(Var(C)) / C}, simplified with the product
             rule when the stock is a product (one pool, or DM pools only),
             e.g. \code{sqrt(AGB_U^2 + (RS / (1 + RS) * RS_U)^2 + CF_U^2)}.

             Evaluate with each element and its relative uncertainty as
             \code{<element>} and \code{<element>_U} (se / mean). Land uses
             without pools (e.g. DG_ratio only) return NA.

## Usage

``` r
fct_cstock_formula2(.carbon)
```

## Arguments

- .carbon:

  Carbon table, from `fct_checkinput()$data$carbon`.

## Value

A tibble with `c_period`, `c_lu`, `c_tot` (stock), `c_tot_V` (variance)
and `c_tot_U` (relative uncertainty).

## Examples

``` r
path    <- system.file("extdata/mocaredd-templatev2-simple.xlsx", package = "mocaredd.dev2")
checked <- fct_checkinput(.path = path)
