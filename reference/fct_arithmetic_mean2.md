# Calculate emissions and IPCC Tier 1 uncertainty from arithmetic means

Analytical counterpart of
[`fct_arithmetic_mean()`](https://gaelso.github.io/mocaredd.dev2/reference/fct_arithmetic_mean.md).
Instead of Monte Carlo simulations, activity data and emission factors
are aggregated deterministically and their uncertainty is propagated
with the IPCC Tier 1 (first-order error propagation) rules: relative
uncertainties combine in quadrature for products and absolute standard
errors combine in quadrature for sums / differences. The propagation is
done numerically over the independent input variables (carbon pool
values, carbon fraction, degradation ratios and activity data), so
correlations introduced by shared inputs (e.g. a degraded land use that
reuses the intact carbon stock, or a global carbon fraction) are handled
consistently.

The result reports, for each reference / monitoring emission level and
for each emission reduction, the mean, its standard error, and the
half-width uncertainty \\U\\ = z \cdot se / \|mean\| \cdot 100\\, where
\\z\\ is the two-sided normal quantile for `setup$conf_level`.

## Usage

``` r
fct_arithmetic_mean2(.checked_data)
```

## Arguments

- .checked_data:

  The list returned by
  [`fct_checkinput()`](https://gaelso.github.io/mocaredd.dev2/reference/fct_checkinput.md).
  Its `template_version` element drives version-specific behaviour and
  its `data` element supplies the `setup`, `time`, `area` and `carbon`
  tables.

## Value

A list with elements `ER` (reference / monitoring levels and emission
reductions with mean, se, U\\ (per time period, with uncertainty),
`gg_emissions` (figure with confidence intervals) and `emissions_table`
(a tidy tibble ready to be turned into a gt table by the app).

library(mocaredd)
#> Error in library(mocaredd): there is no package called ‘mocaredd’

path <- system.file("extdata/mocaredd-templatev2-simple.xlsx", package = "mocaredd.dev2")

checked <- fct_checkinput(.path = path)
